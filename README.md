## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

-**Medical History Tracking:** Enhance the database to include a comprehensive medical history tracking system. This could involve capturing detailed information about a patient's past illnesses, surgeries, allergies, and medical procedures. The system could also allow for the recording of diagnostic reports and treatment outcomes.

-**Billing and Payment Integration:** Integrate a billing and payment module into the database to streamline the financial aspects of the clinic. This feature could include generating invoices automatically based on appointments, prescriptions, and tests, tracking payments and outstanding balances, and providing reports for financial analysis.

-**Inventory Management:** Implement an inventory management system within the database to keep track of medical supplies and equipment. This feature could include managing stock levels, tracking expiration dates, generating alerts for low stock, and providing reports for inventory analysis and purchasing.
